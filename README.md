### What does this offer, you ask?
- ES6, 7, NEXT Support with Babel
- Webpack Bundling with UMD support
- ESLINT code linting

### Setup

First, obviously,
```
$ git clone https://github.com/flasd/library-base myLibrary
```

Then, `cd` into `myLibrary` and run
```
$ node setup
```
Setup will:
- Remove .git folder and initialize a new local repository for you;
- Remove package.json and re-initialize NPM for you;
- Clean up the README.md and the LICENCE file.

### Usage
The entry point is the src/index.js file. Go from there.

### Licence
MIT all the way. Let's create awesome stuff! :rocket:
